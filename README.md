# Game-Until_Last_Asteroid
This is my first game for my portfolio. Its genre is "Shoot 'Em Up". In this game, you control a spaceship and shoot at enemies, including asteroids and other ships. You have multiple lives, earn points, and complete levels.

**Game controls:**<br />
Arrow up    -> Move forward<br />
Arrow left  -> Rotate left<br />
Arrow right -> Rotate right<br />
Arrow down  -> Jump to hyper scape (jump to random position)<br />
Space       -> Shoot<br />
Escape      -> Close the game<br />

**How to play?**<br />
When you launch the game, you'll see the text "Press any key to start". It's a pause menu. Every time you die - you'll see this window. If you want to close the game anytime - just press the Escape key. The game has an infinite number of levels. Every level contains some number of asteroids and saucers. To complete a level, you must destroy them all and wait until all your bullets are disappeared. (Every bullet disappears after 5 seconds). The game has its score. You get points for every destroyed asteroid or saucer. If you gain another 1000 points - you'll get an extra life. At the beginning of the game, you have 3 lives. You lose one life when an asteroid, enemy saucer, or its bullets touch you. If you lose all your lives - the game will restart. The game's world has no boundaries, so if you flew out of the world's one side - you'll appear on its other side.

**Who are the enemies?**<br />
1. Big asteroid - small speed, floats in a random direction. When destroyed, splits into several medium asteroids, and you get +20 points.<br />
2. Medium asteroid - medium speed, floats in a random direction. When destroyed, splits into several small asteroids, and you get +60 points.<br />
3. Small asteroid -  high speed, floats in a random direction, and you get +100 points.<br />
4. Small saucer - rotates slowly, moves toward you, tries to reach and touch you. When destroyed, you'll get +200 points.<br />
5. Big saucer - rotates slowly, moves toward you, shoots you. When destroyed, you'll get +50 points.<br />
